# 🌌 Vintage Presence

### Rich Presence for Vintage Story — currently in early development.

VintagePresence is a **client-side mod** for *Vintage Story* that displays your gameplay activity on Discord. Right now it's functional but minimalist — showing basic presence info while the full feature set is being built.

## 🚧 Current Status

The mod works and connects to Discord properly. What you get today:

* Basic Discord Rich Presence integration
* Game activity detection
* Clean, working presence display

That's it. No fancy templates yet, no GUI, no customization. Just a solid foundation.

## 🔮 What's Coming

Everything below is **in active development** and will roll out progressively:

### Template System & Customization
Dynamic presence text using tokens like `{world}`, `{mode}`, `{deaths}`, `{players}`, `{server}` — fully customizable formatting so your status looks exactly how you want it.

### In-Game Configuration GUI
A proper settings menu where you can toggle what shows up, edit templates, manage privacy settings and configure everything without touching files.

### Privacy Controls
Granular options to hide world names, server info, player counts, death counters — whatever you don't want visible stays hidden. Server IPs will *never* be exposed.

### Discord Buttons
Clickable Rich Presence buttons for linking to your server, mod page, community Discord, whatever you need.

### Advanced Features (Post-Launch)
* Multiple presence profiles
* Biome/temperature/health display
* Time-of-day states
* Per-world presence rules
* Streamer mode presets

## 🛠 Compatibility

Works on:
* Vintage Story 1.21+
* Singleplayer and multiplayer
* Windows, Linux, Steam Deck
* Alongside any other client-side mods

## ⏱️ Development Timeline

Features are being implemented iteratively. The template formatter and data collection layer are done — GUI and user-facing config are next in line. No ETAs, but progress is steady.

## 💬 Feedback

If you're testing the early version and have thoughts on what should be prioritized, open an issue or PR. This exists because the existing presence mods felt too rigid — input from actual players matters here.

**TL;DR:** It works. It's bare-bones. The good stuff is coming. Stay tuned.
